A maze generator that clues you in to the right path via the track you
select. You get to the end when the song gets to the end.

* Click anywhere on the maze to set a new endpoint
* Pick a new track at any time without having to start over
* Change the maze difficulty/speed by changing the size (starts you
  over)

Building
